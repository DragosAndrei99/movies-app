# React + Next application

Welcome to the repository for Movies App.
I have created this project trying to use most of the React main features.

## Instructions

React application with client side rendering:
cd react-practical-task
npm install
npm run dev

Next application with server side rendering:
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev

## Screenshots of the application
